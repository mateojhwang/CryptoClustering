# CryptoClustering

1. CryptoClustering

2. In this project I used unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. I also used PCA to determine how reducing the amount of features would affect the scatter plots and compared visuals.

3. Must have python and all necessary libraries.
